## Why?

- Just a fun project to try out OCR
- Typing Speed Flex

## Installation
There is a requirements.txt file. Install that using pip.
This uses pytesseract and tesseract. I dont remember how to install either.

## Usages

- Change the dimensions of (X,Y) for the **3 lines** and for **last line** from the [monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com) website.
- Input the time of the session of your typing test. 
- You get 2 seconds to switch to the monkeytype window.

## Disclaimer
- It might not work 100% of the time.
- It could get less than 100% due to improper OCR reading.
- First letter may be misread due to cursor.
- Might hang your computer because it is typing so fast.
- I was too dumb to implement an "off switch".
